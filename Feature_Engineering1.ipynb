        "1.What is a parameter?\n",
        "-  In the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning, a parameter is a variable that a model learns from data during the training process. These parameters are internal to the model and are crucial in determining how the model processes input data to make predictions or generate outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is correlation?\n",
        "What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "-  Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other. It quantifies both the strength and direction of this relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  A negative correlation, also known as an inverse correlation, occurs when two variables move in opposite directions. This means that as one variable increases, the other decreases, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "-  Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence where computer systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions—without being explicitly programmed for each task. It’s the approach used to build models that improve over time through experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The loss value (or loss) is a numerical measure of how far a model's predictions deviate from the actual ground truth during training. It’s central to learning because it's the objective function that guides the model to improve—by minimizing this value through optimization techniques like gradient descent. Here's how the loss value helps determine if a model is good:\n",

        "-  Continuous variables are quantitative measurements that can take any value within a range—including decimals or fractions. They are measured, not counted.\n",
        "Examples: Height, weight, time, temperature, blood pressure, financial returns.\n",
        "-   Categorical variables (also called qualitative) represent membership in distinct groups or categories. They may or may not have a natural order.\n",

        "6.How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  When you have categorical variables in machine-learning datasets, they must be converted into numerical form so most models can process them. Here's a comprehensive overview of the most commonly used encoding techniques, why and when each is used:\n",

        "-  The training set is used to teach your ML model how to map inputs to outputs. It typically comprises 60–80% of your total dataset. The model iteratively adjusts its internal parameters (e.g., weights in a neural network) to minimize its error on this data\n",
        "\n",
        "- The test set is a completely separate subset (often 20–30% of the data) that the model has never seen during training or tuning. It serves as a final benchmark of how well the trained model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "-  The Python module sklearn.preprocessing (part of scikit-learn) offers a comprehensive suite of utilities to transform raw feature data into forms suitable for machine learning models. These tools help improve learning efficiency, model performance, and ensure consistent, reliable preprocessing pipelines.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a Test set?\n",
        "-  A test set—also known as a holdout dataset—is a subset of your data that is never used during model training or development. Its sole purpose is to provide an unbiased, final evaluation of how well your fully trained (and tuned) model performs on new, unseen data.\n",
